Hello, 

We are Syntax 2 AKA: S2. We are a group of coders, who make tools in python. Our tools are for educational purposes only.

We are looking for new devs/people whoa are either passionate about coding, and know some python at least or want to be tought, or learn with us.
We are going to be teaching people too.

Besides our intro, this will be the dev notes for the WASTT Tool.
